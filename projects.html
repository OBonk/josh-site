      <p><b>Managed development team for qinetiq 
(2022/23, University of Portsmouth):</b>
Acted as manager for a team of 8, of both in person and remote members, over the course of and academic year to design a virtual showcase of a vehicle control system with virtual and extended reality capabilities, on behalf of qinetiq,that could potentially be applied to a real vehicle, without looking at what is standard for the military, to instead be creative and make something new. Mainly this involves working on a user interface system for a drone with the quest 2s for the use of VR for complete immersion and XR to see their surroundings and swap between these in a combat scenario. 
</p>
<p>
Developed assets for unreal engine 5 (2023, University of Portsmouth):
Worked individually to create modular environmental assets on behalf of my client, Gavin Wade, to be used as part of an upcoming game to be produced in unreal engine 5 as part of my final year project. This gave me the opportunity to research relevant aspects and improvements of the engine such as nanite and how it would impart the production pipeline for game development.
</p>

<p><b>University Game Jams (2022 and 2023, University of Portsmouth):</b>
Created games based on random prompts in 4 days in small teams (4-6). I primarily worked on the 3d assets for the game, along with teaching one member new to game making the process of game design/development and the fundamentals of 3d modelling.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Game Design (2021/22, University of Portsmouth):</b>
Worked with a team of 4 other students to create a board game prototype. Worked on the iterative process of developing the gameâ€™s mechanics, systems and rules structure, coordinating and documenting internal and external playtesting sessions.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Animation production (2021/22 University of Portsmouth):</b>
Worked on an animation over 1 academic year with the prompt of a 3d character and setting, working with highly detailed modelling, retopology, motion capture and environment setup and  rendering.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Game development (2021, University of Portsmouth):</b>
Work with the team long term on a procedurally generated 3d dungeon crawler in unity. Designed, modelled and implemented all hard body assets for the game, created animated effects in unity, and implemented these features to construct modular environments that would be generated procedurally.
