      <p>I modelled this creature as part of a short animation within Unreal Engine, utilising Blender for sculpting, retopology, and animating using mocap data, and substance painter for texturing.
        <br>
        This project gave me the experience of designing flexible flesh-like parts of the body while also working with more rigid parts of the body expected from an exoskeleton creature, and how these different elements would work during animation.
        <br>
        I also worked on 2d reference images to help with modelling and consider how the final design would turn out, for which I used images of natural bugs as well as a few other insectoid characters for various media.
