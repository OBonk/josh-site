    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello, I'm Josh Cursley, a 22-year-old 3D modeller based in the scenic county of Surrey. I hold a degree in Video Game Design from the University of Portsmouth and have a fervent passion for 3D modelling, particularly within the realm of video games. My expertise lies in character modelling and design, and while my portfolio predominantly features fantasy-based models, I'm more than open to exploring other genres.
    <br><br>
I'm currently seeking employment opportunities as a 3D modeller in the video game industry, specifically at a graduate or junior level. I'm committed to bringing creativity, technical skill, and a keen eye for detail to any project I undertake.
<br><br>
If you're interested in collaborating or have any opportunities that align with my skill set, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative and engaging gaming experiences.
